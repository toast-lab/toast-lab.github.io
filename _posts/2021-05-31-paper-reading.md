description: A session for discussing research papers
---

<p>Since the middle of March, a new paper reading session has been regularly held in Toast Lab. It is a weekly event in which a speaker
presents a state-of-the-art research paper while other lab-mates freely express their opinions. The topics cover computer architecture, 
file system and storage, operating systems, software testing, etc. Through this paper session, we intend to gain both knowledge and skills.</p>

<p>The following papers have been discussed by the end of May.</p>
<ul type = "square">
	<li>Scalable Persistent Memory File System with Kernel-Userspace Collaboration</li>
	<li>LB+Trees: Optimizing Persistent Index Performance on 3DXPoint Memory</li>
	<li>Speicher: Securing LSM-based Key-Value Stores using Shielded Execution</li>
	<li>Designing a Cost-Effective Cache Replacement Policy using Machine Learning</li>
	<li>Libnvmmio: Reconstructing Software IO Path with Failure-Atomic Memory-Mapped Interface</li>
	<li>PMTest: A Fast and Flexible Testing Framework for Persistent Memory Programs</li>
	<li>ShieldStore: Shielded In-memory Key-value Storage with SGX</li>
	<li>Density Tradeoffs of Non-Volatile Memory as a Replacement for SRAM based Last Level Cache</li>
	<li>CROSSTALK: Speculative Data Leaks Across Cores Are Real</li>
	<li>ArchTM: Architecture-Aware, High Performance Transaction for Persistent Memory</li>
	<li>Clobber-NVM: Log Less, Re-execute More</li>
	<li>Dead Page and Dead Block Predictors: Cleaning TLBs and Caches Together</li>
</ul>
