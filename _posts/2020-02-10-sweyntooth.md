---

<p>On 9th February 2020, the <a href="https://asset-group.github.io/" target="_blank">ASSET Group</a> of SUTD released <a href="https://asset-group.github.io/disclosures/sweyntooth/" target="_blank">SweynTooth</a>. SweynTooth captures a family of 12 vulnerabilities (more under non-disclosure) across different BLE software development kits (SDKs) of six major system-on-a-chip (SoC) vendors. The vulnerabilities expose flaws in specific BLE SoC implementations that allow an attacker in radio range to trigger deadlocks, crashes and buffer overflows or completely bypass security depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>The main contributor of SweynTooth is <a href="https://matheus-garbelini.github.io/home/" target="_blank">Mr. Matheus E. Garbelini</a>. He is a first-year PhD student of SUTD, working with Dr. Sudipta Chattopadhyay and Chundong.</p>
