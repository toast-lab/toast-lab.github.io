description: A paper on parallelizing transactions for LSM-tree RDBs is accepted by APWeb '24.

<p>Our paper titled "Flutist: Parallelizing Transaction Processing for LSM-tree-based Relational Database" is accepted by the <a href="https://apweb2024.zjnu.edu.cn" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">8th APWeb-WAIM joint international conference on Web and Big Data (APWeb 2024)</a>. In the paper, we take MyRocks, one typical relational database based on LSM-tree storage engine, for study. We find that MyRocks severely suffers from the sequential commits of transactions with RocksDB. We hence propose an algorithm named Flutist that parallelizes transaction processing through concurrent commits with RocksDB and preserves a desired committing order. </p>

<p>This year, APWeb follows the double-blind reviewing policy. It would be held in Jinhua, Zhejiang, China. This work was solely completed by Toast Lab. Three postgraduate students, i.e., Ms. Qing Xu, Mr. Meng Chen, and Mr. Yunxin Yang, in their third, second, and first years in ShanghaiTech, respectively, collaborated to finish it. The first author, Ms. Qing Xu, would soon graduate with a Master's degree. We wish her all the best in her future endeavors.</p>
