description: Our paper on atomic memory-mapped updates with pmem is accepted by DATE 2023.
---

<p>Our paper titled "Atomic but Lazy Updating with Memory-mapped Files for Persistent Memory" is accepted by <a href="https://www.date-conference.com/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">the 26th Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference (DATE 2023)</a>. In the paper, we find that data an application freshly writes needs not be ready in place until the application is to read it. This observation motivates us to lazily update memory-mapped file pages stored in persistent memory (pmem), which helps to yield high performance without losing failure atomicity.</p>

<p>Mr Qisheng Jiang and Mr Lei Jia, two Master's students of Toast Lab, jointly work out the paper. DATE 2023 will take place in Antwerp, Belgium, from 17 to 19 April, 2023.</p>
