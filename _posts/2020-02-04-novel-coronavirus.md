<p>Because of <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019" target="_blank">the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)</a>, the commencement of Toast Lab would be postponed.</p>

<p>We believe the virus would be defeated soon. We wish everyone a healthy and prosperous Chinese New Year.</p>
