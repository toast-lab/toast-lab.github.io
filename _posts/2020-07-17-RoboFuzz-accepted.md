---

<p>Our paper titled "How to Secure Autonomous Mobile Robots? An Approach of Fuzzing, Detection, and Mitigation" is accepted by the <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-systems-architecture/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">the Journal of Systems Architecture: Embedded Software Design (JSA)</a>. It details how we systematically fuzz an autonomous mobile robot in order to inflicit concrete attacks on the robot and how we defend against such attacks to enhance the security of the robot.</p>

<p>JSA is a journal covering all design and architectural aspects related to embedded systems and software.</p>
