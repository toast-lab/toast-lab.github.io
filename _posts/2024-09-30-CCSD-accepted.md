<p>Our paper titled "Bit-Sparsity Aware Acceleration with Compact CSD Code on Generic Matrix Multiplication" is accepted by the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=12" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">IEEE Transactions on Computers (TC)</a>. The ever-increasing demand for matrix multiplication in artificial intelligence (AI) and generic computing emphasizes the necessity of efficient computing power accommodating both floating-point and quantized integer. While state-of-the-art bit-sparsity-aware acceleration techniques have demonstrated impressive performance and efficiency in neural networks through software-driven methods such as pruning and quantization, these approaches are not always feasible in typical generic computing scenarios. In this paper, we propose Bit-Cigma, a hardware-centric architecture that leverages bit-sparsity to accelerate generic matrix multiplication. Experimental results confirm that Big-Cigma achieves high performance, area efficiency, and energy efficiency.</p>
