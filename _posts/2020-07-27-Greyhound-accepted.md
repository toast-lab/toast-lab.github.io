---

<p>Our paper titled "GREYHOUND: Directed Greybox Wi-Fi Fuzzing" is accepted by the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8858" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing (TDSC)</a>. In the paper, we conceptualize, design and implement a directed fuzzing methodology named GREYHOUND that automatically tests the Wi-Fi client implementations against vulnerabilities such as crashes or non-compliant behaviours.</p>

<p>IEEE TDSC is widely considered as a prestigious journal in the domain of dependable and secure computing.</p>
