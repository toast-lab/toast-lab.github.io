description: Our paper on reducing conflict cache misses is accepted by ASP-DAC 2023.
---

<p>Our paper titled "Exploring Architectural Implications to Boost Performance for in-NVM B+-tree" is accepted by <a href="https://www.aspdac.com/aspdac2023/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">the 28th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC 2023)</a>. In the paper, we consider the presence of eADR and analyze the increasing impact of conflict cache misses on in-NVM B+-tree. We accordingly design a strategy named Conan (<strong>co</strong>nflict-aware <strong>n</strong>ode <strong>a</strong>llocatio<strong>n</strong>) that manages the NVM space with a VIPT set-associative cache of modern CPUs. Experiments show that Conan effectively reduces cache misses and improves performance for in-NVM B+-tree.</p>


<p>Mr Yanpeng Hu and Mr Qisheng Jiang, two 2nd-year postgraduate students of Toast Lab, collaborate on the paper. ASP-DAC 2023 will take place in Tokyo, Japan, from 16 to 19 January, 2023.</p>
