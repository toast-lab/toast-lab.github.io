description: A paper about atomic durability with pmem is accepted by ACM TECS.
---

<p>Our paper titled "Hercules: Enabling Atomic Durability for Persistent Memory with Transient Persistence Domain" is accepted by the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/tecs" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS)</a>. In the paper, we conceptualize, design and implement a new algorithm named Hercules that exploits the transiently persistent CPU cache hierarchy to enable atomic durability for data that applications place in the persistent memory (pmem).</p>

<p>ACM TECS is widely considered as a prestigious journal in the domain of embedded computing systems and architectures.</p>
