description: IOLeak is a new side channel exploiting CPU frequency through I/Os.
---

<p>CPU frequency scaling is widely employed to dynamically adjust the speed and voltage of CPU cores in real time, aiming
to achieve both high performance and power efficiency. Prior 
work indicates that variations in CPU frequency can leak
information about the workload being processed. We find
that the performance of I/O requests, such as file I/Os with a
fast storage device, is affected by runtime changes in CPU
frequency and, in turn, reflects the behavior of ongoing work-
load. Accordingly, we develop <b>IOLeak</b>, a new side-channel
built on CPU frequency scaling without directly accessing
CPU frequency. We first construct an IOLeak covert channel
by detecting I/O latency online for secretive communication,
both with and without noise. Next, we leverage IOLeak to
launch stealthy attacks, such as extracting cryptographic
keys and fingerprinting websites and confirm that IOLeak
manages to leak information through file I/Os. </p>

<p>We have made a <a href="https://toast-lab.github.io/publications/releases/IOLeak/index.html" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">webpage</a>  to present IOLeak. AMD has issued a relevant <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7042.html" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">post</a>.
