<p>Our paper titled "NobLSM: An LSM-tree with Non-blocking Writes for SSDs" is accepted by <a href="https://www.dac.com/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">the 59th Design Automation Conference (DAC 2022)</a>. In the paper, we develop an LSM-tree variant named NobLSM which is without blocking fsyncs on the critical path of major compaction.</p>

<p>DAC is ranked as a CCF A conference. This year it will take place in San Francisco from 10 to 14 July. The first author of this paper, Mr Haoran Dang, is currently a final-year undergraduate student of ShanghaiTech University. </p>
