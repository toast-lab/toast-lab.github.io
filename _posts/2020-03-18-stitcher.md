<p>The increasing adoption of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices brings new challenges to digital forensic investigators (DFIs) when they investigate cybercrimes on these new platforms. In a recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07242.pdf" target="_blank">preprint</a> (<i>Stitcher: Correlating Digital Forensic Evidenceon Internet-of-Things Devices</i>) released by the <a href="https://asset-group.github.io/" target="_blank">ASSET Group</a> of SUTD, researchers conducted a user study with 39 DFIs from both public and private sectors regarding such challenges. They detailed their findings and accordingly proposed a tool named Stitcher to support DFIs in handling IoT forensics investigations. More details can be found in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07242.pdf" target="_blank">preprint</a>. 

<p>The main contributor of the user study and the tool is <a href="https://poppopretn.com/" target="_blank">Mr. Yee Ching Tok</a>. He is a second-year PhD student of SUTD, working with <a href="https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/sudipta-chattopadhyay" target="_blank">Dr. Sudipta Chattopadhyay</a> and Chundong.</p>
