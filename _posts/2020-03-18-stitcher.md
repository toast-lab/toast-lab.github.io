<p>The increasing adoption of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices brings new challenges to digital forensic investigators (DFIs) when they investigate cybercrimes on these new platforms. In a recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07242.pdf" target="_blank">preprint</a> (<i>Stitcher: Correlating Digital Forensic Evidenceon Internet-of-Things Devices</i>) released by the <a href="https://asset-group.github.io/" target="_blank">ASSET Group</a> of SUTD, researchers conducted a user study with 39 DFIs from both public and private sectors regarding such challenges. They itemized their findings and accordingly proposed a tool named Stitcher to support DFIs in handling IoT forensics investigations. More details can be found in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07242.pdf" target="_blank">preprint</a>. The tool is available at this <a href="https://github.com/poppopretn/Stitcher" target="_blank">link</a>.</p>

<p>The user study and the tool were mainly made by <a href="https://poppopretn.com/" target="_blank">Mr. Yee Ching Tok</a>. He is a second-year PhD student of SUTD, working with Dr. Sudipta Chattopadhyay and Chundong. Yee Ching also has served as an executive committee member in <a href="https://www.aisp.sg/" target="_blank">the Association of Information Security Professionals in Singapore</a>, an Adjunct Lecturer at <a href="https://www.sp.edu.sg/" target="_blank">Singapore Polytechnic</a>, and a SANS Mentor for <a href="https://www.sans.org/" target="_blank">SANS Institute</a>.</p>
