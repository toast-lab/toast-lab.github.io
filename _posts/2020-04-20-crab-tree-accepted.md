<p>Our paper titled "<a href="https://asset-group.github.io/papers/TECS-2019-0129.R1-main.pdf" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Crab-tree: A Crash Recoverable B+-tree Variant for Persistent Memory with ARMv8 Architecture</a>" is accepted by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3396236" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS)</a>. The first version of the paper was presented in <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/LCTES-2019" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">the 20th ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on Languages, Compilers, and Tools for Embedded Systems.</a> In the conference version, we proposed Crab-tree that is a B+-tree variant for byte-addressable non-volatile memory operated by ARMv8 processors. The newer version contains several techniques to further optimize Crab-tree.</p>


<p>ACM TECS is widely considered to be one of the prestigious journals in the domain of embedded systems.</p>
