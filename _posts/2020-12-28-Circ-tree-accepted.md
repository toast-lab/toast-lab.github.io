<p>Our paper titled "Circ-Tree: A B+-Tree Variant with Circular Design for Persistent Memory" is accepted by the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=12" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">IEEE Transactions on Computers (TC)</a>. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09783" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">A preliminary version of the paper was released on 20th December, 2019</a>. Circ-Tree is a B+-tree variant for byte-addressable non-volatile memories (NVM). The circular node structure of Circ-Tree makes it exactly appropriate for emerging NVM, like STT-MRAM. Through a strategy of bidirectional shifting upon an insertion/deletion, Circ-Tree yields much higher performance than state-of-the-art B+-tree variants with the classic unidirectional shifting over sorted tree nodes. </p>

<p>IEEE TC is widely considered as a prestigious journal in the domain of computer science.</p>
