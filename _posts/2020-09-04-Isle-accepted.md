description: Our paper about Isle-Tree is accepted by ICCD 2020.
---

<p>Our paper titled "Isle-Tree: A B+-Tree with Intra-Cache Line Sorted Leaves for Non-volatile Memory" is accepted by <a href="http://iccd-conf.com/Home.html" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">the 38th IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD 2020)</a>. In the paper, we propose a B+-tree variant named Isle-Tree for non-volatile memory. Each cache line of Isle-Tree's leaf node is sorted while the entire node is unsorted (semi-sorted). For a common insertion without split, only one cache line of key-value pairs needs to be flushed for Isle-Tree.</p>


<p>ICCD 2020 will take place virtually from 18 to 21 October, 2020.</p>
